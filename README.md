# Mini-Beat-em-up-Arcade-Sticks
3D Printable mini arcade sticks for use with your favorite emulators and DIY projects.   Intended for beat'em up style arcade games, which need less buttons than your conventional fighting stick.

This small size and 4 button layout is ideal for 4p+ arcade games like TMNT, Simpsons, NBA Jam, Xmen etc.  Using a curved top also makes it much more comfortable to hold and play on.

The following 3D files will enable you print as many beat'em up sticks are you need (each part will take about 3-6hrs to print depending on quality and print speed).

- **Top - Curved with Dome.stl**  (Printer notes: suggest to print vertical with the flat back on the printer bed - this will provide the best curved print-  no supports needed)
- **Middle - 3mm holes.stl** (Printer note: will need build plate supports for the cable hole and screw tabs)
- **Bottom - filled - 3mm.stl** (Printer note: no supports needed)

**Printer Settings**
- Print with PLA or PETG, only the top part should be printed vertical.
- I used 15% infill which provided ample strength.

**Parts**
- 1 x JLF or  clone arcade stick (standard holes)
- 4 x  Arcade joystick mounting bolts  (or an equivalent from hardware shop) - these are easily purchased cheaply via ebay/ali.
- 4 x 30mm arcade buttons (or equivalent note: holes are 30mm)
- 2 x 24mm arcade buttons (for Coin / Start)
- 1 x Encoder PCB (either purchase one from ebay/ali or make your own arduino based arcade encoder (ie plenty of cool projects like [Demonbite ](https://github.com/MickGyver/DaemonBite-Retro-Controllers-USB or see my other projects if you want to make a DIY arduino  XBOX 360 for PC usb encoder https://github.com/dekkit/Arcade-to-Xbox360-PC-USB-Encoder/)
- 8 x M3 self tapping screws (~5mm in length - suggest to buy a box of varying lengths to allow for printing differences). Alternatively you can use various glue to affix the top on or even 4 long screws.
- 4 x rubber feet to avoid scratching tables etc.
